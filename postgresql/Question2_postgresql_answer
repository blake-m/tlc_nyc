/*
This script answers the following question:
- How were cash and credit card payments developing in 2014 (here: july)?

Fields I use:
	pickup_datetime - I will consider it as the time of a trip
	total_amount - it includes all payment and additional fees

NOTE: I subtract tip_amount from total_amount where payment is not cash, as cash tips
are not included in this dataset and looking at them might give misleading results.

/*
payment_type - according to the dictionary from the Google cloud:
A numeric code signifying how the passenger paid for the trip.
	1= Credit card
	2= Cash
	3= No charge
	4= Dispute
	5= Unknown
	6= Voided trip
